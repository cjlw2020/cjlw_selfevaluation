Everything about this class was exaclty what I expected and hoped to wanted to learn about R. I was simpily unprepared to manage the hand that life delt me.

##Instructions

***

Please download this Markdown file (`selfevaluation.Rmd`) from my GitHub site (in the `fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/` folder) and answer the appropriate questions in the spaces provided. Once you've knitted the final file, please *email* the **html** version of that file to me with the name `[LastF]_F19_SelfEvaluation.html` (with `LastF` meaning your last name followed by your first initial, i.e., mine would be called `SchmittC_F19_SelfEvaluation.html`). I must receive this file by **Midnight of December 17, 2019**.

###Overall Impression

***

In place of my name as author on this Markdown file, please insert your own, along with the date on which you completed this self-assessment. In place of the RuPaul GIF, above, please choose a GIF of a drag queen that best exemplifies your overall feelings about what you learned/accomplished in this course. Additionally, replace the `The following self evaluation...` text below your GIF with a three sentence summary of your experience in the class and what you take away from it to accompany that GIF. You may also choose a catchy title.

###How well did you accomplish them?

***

I regret being unable to complete all the provided materials, assignments, and contributions to peer commentary as anyone would given my circumstnace. I have already explained my semester to you and there is no need to do so again but I do feel that I gave everything I had left to this course. The best example of my work is provided in the Group Module. I worked for many hours to provide most of the code for part 1 of the module. 

***

###How has your understanding of and approach to statistics and project design changed since taking this course?

***

Prior to this course, my understanding of statistics extended only just past the basics of introductory college stats. I had worked with information gathered from field research and applied mathmatical equations to variables provided to me in controled circumstances. This course was my first experience having to look at a data set and develop analysis that would fit the data. It's still a foreign concept to me but after working through this class and GE505 "Introduction to Graduate GIS" I have a much better grasp of how this side of research works. 

***

###What did you learn from all this?

***

Predominantly learing to operate a coding interface such as RStudio was a huge accomplishment in my eyes. I've often distanced myself from computers and coding sounded like the most gruling task I had ever heard of. I also feel considerably better about basis statistical analysis that I had worked with previosuly such as anova and paried T test, but never truly understood how they operated. Learning to code properly with good annotations and dialog is another critical componet of what I see myself retaining for the future.

***

###How did the Peer Commentary process and Group Project relate, if at all, to what you view as your successes or difficulties in this course?

***

Although I did not participate in the peer commentary aspect of this class I recognize the value it held by providing an interface between learing away from formal instruction. The Group Project was in my opion the best assignment of this course. Working with Ena and Nicola on a project that stretched each of our capacities to do compute information is this foreign manner was a perfect learning environment.
Anytime one of us cam across problems we could reference one another and my learing was exponential faster than other components of the course. 

***

###What, if anything, of lasting value do you take away from this experience? If nothing, what would you do differently if you were to start over in this course? 

***

I think understanding that it is ok that i might not fully understand a statistical process or method of coading is a large load off of my chest. Watching you sometime flaunder looking for the right code or sloution to the problem gave a better appreciation for how i can and will implement R in the future.

***

###Taking this self-assessment into account (and with **A** being the highest), if you were the instructor, what grade would you give yourself given your evaluation of your own performance this semester? Please be honest.

***

C. I started with no coading experience prior to this course and feel that i progressed to a point that self learing and practice is all i will need to become truly proficient in the program. The statistics and coading language will become more natural with time. Due to this and the percieved effor that I attempted to make with this course, although failing at times, makes me feel like i have sucessfuly tackled this project to the point where i will be self sufficient for the future. I believe I received a grade of a C for competency and commitment to the course.
